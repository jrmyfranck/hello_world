This is me learning version control. Nothing to see, really.

I have to say, while the idea of version control and its underlying workings are great, the execution isn't very user-friendly. It feels like a tool by programmers, for programmers. I admire and appreciate the system behind it, but they really should learn to be more flexible.

Everyone seems to hate Apple's Time Machine —even Apple itself, apparently, given its lack of updates and communication— but they managed to make it a lot simpler.
